The project is based on a dataset provided by EDX through https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/ 
We will have to analyze the data using visualization knowledge to make summaries of what we observe.
The objective is to use the edx dataset provided to experiment with multiple parameters and/or use cross-validation to create a machine learning that gives us an RMSE < 0.86490.
